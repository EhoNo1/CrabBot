**Contributing**

Be respectful, obviously.

**Keep it Simple**
You must explain your contributions in the commit. If it's too long, you can probably break it down into multiple commits.
Ensure your contributions are not immediatly incompatable with any relevant existing parts and contribution.
Break unrelated parts and modifications of parts into separate commits if possible.
Avoid overcomplicating systems and components.

**Part And Adapter Related**
If your contribution is for specific electronic parts or controllers, it must be in the Component Specific folder and labled by the marketing name of the component.

**Stay in Touch**
Try to keep the version of the repo you are working on up to date, consider updating it before working. 

**Work Smart**
You are welcome make personal forks to add up multiple work sessions into one commit.
Pull requests must be focused on a specific localized parts of the project, and not minor tweaks all over the project.
