*Contributing*

Be respectful, obviously.
You must explain your contributions in the commit.
Ensure your contributions are not immediatly incompatable with any relevant existing parts and contribution.
Break unrelated parts and modifications of parts into separate commits if possible.
If your contribution is for specific electronic parts or controllers, it must be in the Component Specific folder and labled by the marketing name of the component.
Try to keep the version of the repo you are working on up to date, consider updating it before working.
