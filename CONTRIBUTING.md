# Contributing

## Kindness and Respect
Be respectful, obviously. And don't be an ass, obviously. (This can include smartassing).

## Keep it Simple
You must be able explain your contributions in the commit. If it's too long or complex, you can probably break it down into multiple commits.
Ensure your contributions are not immediatly incompatable with any relevant existing parts and contribution.
Break unrelated parts and modifications of parts into separate commits if possible.
Avoid overcomplicating systems and components.

## Don't Upload Precompiled Files
To ensure the digital safety of the users of this project; only specific, trusted contributors may upload prerenderd/precomiled files.

### Rendering Trusted Users

EhoNo1

Files do not need to be fully rendered unless its a for a notable release, in which case, one of these users will hopefully go ahead and render ALL the files in the project.

## Part And Adapter Related Contributions
If your contribution is for specific electronic parts or controllers, it must be in the Component Specific folder and labled by the marketing name of the component.

## Stay in Touch
Try to keep the version of the repo you are working on up to date, consider updating it before working.
If you are adding something complex, you are welcome to create your own work branch to make the changes, try to avoid this with pre-existing parts though.
