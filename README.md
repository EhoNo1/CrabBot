# FAQ
## What Does It Do?
This robot is designed to be a cheap, accessible 'worker bee' like robot.
It is currently incomplete, support is appreciated.

## Is it done?
No, but its still being worked on! 
Contributions of any kind are apprecated and encouraged!

## How Can I help?
I'm glad you asked! One of the goals of this project was to simplify robot automation; as a result, all of our 3D schematics (and as much of the actual code) are as simple as possible to improve accessibility. That being said; if you have any questions at all, please ask them in the **Issues** tab.

## I don't know how to code, can I still help?
Of course! You can use the **Issues** tab to help us by giving us *Suggestions* and asking any *Questions* you may have, and looking things up starting discussions on it for us! Just please be sure to tag your post properly!
We appreciate anything you can do even if its just an internet high-five.

## Hey, you made an error!
Oh, sorry. Please send that to the **Issues** tab and let us know so we can fix it!
