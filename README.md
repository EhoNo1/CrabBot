# CrabBot
Open Source Crab Worker Robot

THIS PROJECT IS STILL UNDER HEAVY DEVELOPMENT
EXPECT HIGH INSTABILITY AND MAJOR CHANGES
PROPOSED USES ARE CURRENTLY UNTESTED AND HYPOTHETICAL

# About


# What Does It Do?
This robot is designed to be a cheap, accessible 'worker bee' like robot.
The hope is that it is simple enough to lower the barrier of entry. Using only 3D printed and off-the-shelf parts. Cost/task prioritizing electonic components may be available in the future.
It is open source so it can be used for numerous tasks.

The original concept was designed to be used to mine landfills for precious metals, and other usable material. However it is most likely possible use it for farming of medium to small feilds.

# How 'Smart' is It?
Each drone isn't designed to be 'intelegent' the poses basic navigational and spacial awareness, but require the connection of a mother controller to actually tell them what to do.

In other words, they don't think, they just take orders. This allows their code to run on cheaper, potentially even recycled hardware.

# Why a Crab?
Crabs are small, low to the ground and lightweight. They poses numerous legs that alow the crabs body to effectivley glide over terrian. They have wide backs that could be covered in solar panels for passive charging during rest periods.

Such a robot would have a smaller footprint (environmentally and physically) and hopefully could be built using mostly recycled material.
